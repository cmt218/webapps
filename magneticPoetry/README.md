# Magnetic-Poetry
Simple fridge magnet app made for a web applications course. Simply launch the html page to use. The tiles "Web", "Apps", 
"Magnetic", and "Poetry" are persistent. Add your own tiles by typing some text and clicking add. If you want to get rid of a 
tile drag it to the trash can. The app writes the tiles and their location to local storage on page unload so if you close
it and open again they will still be there. If you want to clear the local storage simply click clear memory.
