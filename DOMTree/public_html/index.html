                <h1>Bio</h1>
                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Cole was born in Doylestown, PA in February 1996. He went to
                    preschool somewhere he doesn't remember the name of and then 
                    went to elementary school at Gayman. He then went on to middle
                    school at Tohickon. Eventually he went to high school at CB East
                    Cole ran track in high school and it was a good time. He was 
                    accepted into Lehigh sometime during the winter of 2013.</p>
                
                <h2>Life at Lehigh</h2>
                <p>Cole's freshman year at Lehigh he had a single in Dravo. Dravo 
                    was kind of a weird place, but his hall had great people on it.
                    Sophomore year Cole decided his major was going to be Materials
                    Science and he went on to have an internship at GTP that summer.
                    The internship was horrible and Cole realized computer science 
                    is way better so he came back for summer session and switched 
                    his major. Cole is now a Junior Computer Science major and its 
                    great. </p>
                    
                <h2>Future Goals</h2>
                <p>Cole is going to have an internship this summer which may or
                    may not lead to a full time job he will take after graduation.
                    Once Cole has a few years of work experience under his belt 
                    he will start his own company and be a billionaire.</p>
